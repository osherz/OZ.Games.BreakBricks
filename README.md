# OZ.Games.BreakBricks
My first "serious" game when I learnt C# and WinForm.

Note:
Part of my sprites and other graphics resouce are from the Internet.
Unfortunately, I didn't checd about their license.
So if someone see any sprites that I used by mistake, I'll glad to hear about that.
And I'm sorry about that, of course.
